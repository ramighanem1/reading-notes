# Pain and Suffering

## main challenges faced by beginners when learning Python

* Syntax: Beginners may find it difficult to understand the syntax.

* Indentation: Python uses indentation to define blocks of code, which can be confusing for beginners who are used to using  {} to define blocks of code in other programming languages.

* Errors: beginners may struggle with identifying and fixing errors in their code.

## Strategies for overcoming these challenges:

* Practice regularly and consistently

* Seek help and support from a community

* Time complexity : refers to the amount of time an algorithm takes to complete 

* space complexity :  refers to the amount of memory an algorithm uses .
