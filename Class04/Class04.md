# The main differences between classes and objects

* A class is a template for creating objects, while an object is an instance of a class

* A class defines the properties and behaviors of an object, while an object has its own unique set of values for those properties.

* Classes can inherit attributes and methods from other classes, while objects cannot.


# recursion function and the best practices to follow when implementing it

recursion function is a function calls itself one or more times until a base condition is met

## When implementing a recursive function follow this steps:

* define a base case that will terminate the recursion.

* Make sure that the recursive calls to the function are getting closer to the base case.

* test the function with different inputs.


# pytest fixtures and code coverage

pytest fixtures and code coverage are important concepts in testing Python code.

By using pytest fixtures, you can create reusable code that can be shared across multiple tests. This makes the tests more maintainable and reduces duplication of code.

By using code coverage, you can identify areas of the code that are not being tested and add tests to increase coverage.
