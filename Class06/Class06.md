# Random Module

The random module in Python allows you to generate random numbers and contains functions such as randint, random, choice, shuffle, and randrange. randint generates a random integer between a lowest and a highest number, random generates a random float between 0 and 1, choice picks a random element from a list, shuffle shuffles a list in place, and randrange generates a randomly selected element from a specified range.

## code :


```
import random

# generates a random integer between 10 and 20
num = random.randint(10, 20)  

# generates a random float between 0 and 50
num = random.random() * 50  

# chooses a random element from the list
myList = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
element = random.choice(myList)  

# shuffles the elements in the list randomly
myList = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
random.shuffle(myList)  

# generates a random number between 0 and 100 in increments of 10
num = random.randrange(0, 101, 10)  

```


# Risk Analysis:

Risk analysis is a crucial process in software development that involves identifying and assessing potential risks and assigning a level of risk. The aim is to mitigate risks and address any damage that may arise from them. Some possible risks include using new hardware, new technology, or new automation tools, as well as the sequence of code and the availability of test resources. There are also unavoidable risks, such as the time allocated for testing, defects that may occur due to the complexity or size of the application, urgency from clients, and incomplete requirements. To address these risks, developers and managers can conduct a risk assessment review meeting, use maximum resources to work on high-risk areas, create a risk assessment database for future use, and identify and notice the risk magnitude indicators (high, medium, or low). There are three perspectives to consider in risk assessment: effect, cause, and likelihood. To perform risk analysis, one must search for risks, analyze the impact of each individual risk, and identify measures to address the risks.



# Test Coverage

Test coverage is a useful tool to find untested parts of a codebase, but it is of little use as a numeric statement of how good your tests are, and high coverage numbers are too easy to reach with low-quality testing. Sufficiency of testing is much more complicated than coverage can answer, and you can test too much if it slows you down or creates duplication in tests. Test coverage helps you find which parts of your code aren't being tested and should be used as a tool to improve your testing strategy.

# Big O

Big O notation is a mathematical notation used to describe the time complexity of an algorithm. It gives an upper bound on the worst-case time complexity of an algorithm in terms of the size of its input. For example, an algorithm that takes O(n) time means that the worst-case time to complete the algorithm is proportional to the size of the input data.
