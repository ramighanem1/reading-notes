The Python statistics module includes functions for computing fundamental statistical measurements including mean, median, mode, variance, and standard deviation. These functions are useful for analyzing data and gaining insights.

Example :

```
import statistics

data = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]
stdev = statistics.stdev(data)
print(stdev)
```
