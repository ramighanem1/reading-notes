# Stack

stack is a linear data structure that follows the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle, which means that the last item added to the stack is the first one to be removed.

## Common operations :

* Push: Adding an item to the top of the stack.
* Pop: Removing the top item from the stack.
* Peek: Viewing the value of the top item without removing it.
* IsEmpty: Checking if the stack is empty. 

## Stacks are efficient O(1) in

* push
* pop
* peek 

# Queue

queue is a linear data structure that follows the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle, which means that the first item added to the queue is the first one to be removed.

## Common operations :

* Enqueue: Adding an item to the rear of the queue.
* Dequeue: Removing the front item from the queue.
* Peek: Viewing the value of the front item without removing it.
* IsEmpty: Checking if the queue is empty.

## Stacks are efficient O(1) in

* enqueue 
* dequeue
