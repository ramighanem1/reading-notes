# Jupyter Lab

Jupyter Lab is a web-based interactive development environment

## benefits :

* users can work with multiple notebooks, code files, and other data at the same time.
* ability to display different types of data in various formats, including tables, graphs, images, and interactive widgets
* supports multiple programming languages ,including Python

# NumPy

NumPy is a Python library that provides essential functionalities for scientific computing and data manipulation tasks. It is a fundamental tool for data analysis, machine learning, and other scientific computing fields.

## NumPy function : 

* np.array(): creates an array from a list or tuple.
* np.zeros(): returns an array filled with zeros.
* np.ones(): returns an array filled with ones.
* np.random.rand(): generates an array of random numbers between 0 and 1.
* np.random.randn(): generates an array of random numbers from a standard normal distribution.
* np.reshape(): returns a new array with a changed shape.
* np.dot(): performs matrix multiplication.
* np.sum(): returns the sum of array elements.
* np.mean(): returns the mean of array elements.
* np.std(): returns the standard deviation of array elements.
* np.max(): returns the maximum value in an array.
* np.min(): returns the minimum value in an array.
* np.argmax(): returns the index of the maximum value in an array.
* np.argmin(): returns the index of the minimum value in an array.

# NumPy arrays

NumPy arrays are the fundamental data structure provided by the NumPy library. They are similar to Python lists but have many additional features that make them useful for scientific computing and data manipulation tasks.

## example:

```
import numpy as np

# 1D
a = np.array([1, 2, 3])

# 2D
b = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]])
```
