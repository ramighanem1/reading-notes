#  Linear regression

Linear regression is a fundamental concept in machine learning and data analysis The basic idea behind linear regression is to find the equation of a straight line that represents the relationship between the independent variables.


##  The purpose of linear regression :

* Prediction

* Relationship Analysis

* Feature Engineering 


##  linear regression model steps:

* Import Libraries
* Prepare Data
* Create and Fit the Model
* Make Predictions


## Splitting the dataset into train and test:

The purpose of this split is to simulate how well the model will generalize to unseen data. The train set is used to train the model, while the test set is used to evaluate its performance.
