#  data visualization libraries 

* Matplotlib : it is a versatile plotting library that provides fine-grained control over plot elements, making it suitable for creating static, highly customized visualizations

* Seaborn : built on top of Matplotlib, focuses on statistical visualization, offering a simplified interface and attractive default styles. It is ideal for quickly creating visually appealing plots and exploring relationships between variables.

* Bokeh : it is designed for interactive visualizations in web browsers, allowing for zooming, panning, and tooltips. It excels in building interactive dashboards, real-time streaming data visualizations, and web-based applications.



#  main functions to create relational, categorical, and distribution plots in Seaborn library :

* Relational plots : scatterplot() and lineplot() , which visualize the relationship between numerical variables or show trends over time

* categorical plots : barplot() displays the distribution or comparison of a categorical variable, while countplot() shows the frequency of occurrences for each category.

* distribution plots : histplot() represents the distribution of a numerical variable using bins, while kdeplot() provides a smooth estimate of the underlying distribution.
