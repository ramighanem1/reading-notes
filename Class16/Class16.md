# Key Characteristics of Serverless Computing:

* No Server Management.

* Event-Driven Execution.

* Function-Centric.

* Automatic Scaling.

* Pay-per-Use Pricing.

It differs from traditional architectures by abstracting infrastructure management, simplifying resource allocation, offering automatic scaling, introducing cost efficiency, and allowing developers to concentrate on application development.

# To get started with Vercel and deploy a serverless function, you can follow these main steps:

* Sign up for a Vercel account on vercel.com.

* Install the Vercel CLI by running npm install -g vercel in your terminal.

* Navigate to your project's root directory in the terminal.

* Run vercel init to initialize a new Vercel project and create a vercel.json configuration file.

* Create a folder (e.g., api) to store your serverless functions.

* Inside the api folder, create a JavaScript or TypeScript file for your function (e.g., hello.js or hello.ts).

* Write your serverless function code in the created file.

* Deploy the serverless function by running vercel in the terminal.

* Test your deployed serverless function using the provided URL or tools like cURL or Postman.

# APIs (Application Programming Interfaces)

APIs are sets of rules and protocols that allow different software applications to communicate and interact with each other. They define how different components of software systems should interact, specifying the methods and data formats they should use.

## To utilize APIs in Python applications, you can follow these general steps:

* Find the API.

* Read the API documentation.

* Choose an HTTP library.

* Make API requests.

* Handle the API response.

* Extract and manipulate data.

* Error handling.

* Test and iterate.

## basic GET request using the Requests library:

```
python
Copy code
import requests

# Make a GET request to a specific URL
response = requests.get('https://api.example.com/endpoint')

# Check the response status code
if response.status_code == 200:
    # Request was successful
    data = response.json()  # Parse the response as JSON
    print(data)
else:
    # Request failed
    print('Request failed with status code', response.status_code)
```
