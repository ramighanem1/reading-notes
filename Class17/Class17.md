# The key differences between scraping static and dynamic websites

The key differences between scraping static and dynamic websites lie in the structure, content generation, and extraction process. Static websites have a fixed structure, and data can be easily extracted by parsing the HTML source code. On the other hand, dynamic websites generate content dynamically using client-side technologies like JavaScript. Scraping dynamic websites requires executing JavaScript code, handling asynchronous data loading, monitoring network requests, and extracting data from the rendered HTML after JavaScript execution. It can be more complex and resource-intensive compared to static scraping, often involving tools like Playwright, Selenium, or Puppeteer to interact with the website and retrieve the complete and up-to-date content.

# To avoid being blocked while scraping websites, it is important to follow these three techniques:

* Respect robots.txt: Check the website's robots.txt file to understand its crawling preferences and avoid scraping restricted areas.

* Use delays and randomization: Introduce delays between requests to mimic human behavior and prevent overwhelming the website. Randomize the delay intervals and vary user agents and IP addresses for each request.

* Scrape responsibly: Extract only necessary data, avoid aggressive scraping techniques, and adhere to the website's terms of service. Seek permission if needed and be mindful of the website's resources.

# What is Playwright

Playwright is an open-source library that enables browser automation and simplifies web scraping tasks. It provides a high-level API for interacting with web browsers, making it particularly useful for scraping dynamic websites that heavily rely on JavaScript for content rendering. Playwright can handle JavaScript-heavy websites effortlessly, allowing developers to automate tasks, interact with elements, and extract data from fully rendered web pages. It excels at scraping single-page applications (SPAs) or websites with AJAX calls and dynamic content loading. With Playwright, developers can automate scrolling, wait for content to load, and extract the required information, making it a valuable tool for scraping JavaScript-driven web applications

# Xpath in web scraping

Xpath is a query language used in web scraping to navigate and select specific elements within an HTML or XML document. It allows developers to locate elements based on their structure, attributes, or text content. Xpath expressions use a path-like syntax and enable traversal of the document's hierarchy to identify and extract desired elements. It provides a powerful and flexible way to target specific elements during web scraping tasks. By using Xpath, developers can precisely select elements of interest, facilitating the extraction of relevant data from web pages.
