# JSON Web Tokens (JWTs)

JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) are used to securely transmit information between parties, primarily for authentication and authorization in web applications and APIs. A JWT consists of three parts: header, payload, and signature. The header and payload are JSON objects that are Base64Url encoded. The header contains token information, and the payload contains claims and metadata. The encoded header and payload are concatenated to form the unsigned JWT. The JWT is then signed using a secret or private key, creating a signature that ensures its integrity. To validate and decode a JWT, the recipient splits it into its parts, verifies the signature, and decodes the Base64Url encoded header and payload. This allows access to the claims for authentication and authorization. JWTs are self-contained and can be trusted without consulting the issuer or a centralized server. They are compact and suitable for use in URLs or HTTP headers.

# JWT Authentication integrate with Django REST Framework 

JWT authentication can be integrated with Django REST Framework (DRF) to secure API endpoints. This integration involves key components such as DRF, JSON Web Tokens (JWTs), authentication backends, token generation, token validation, user authentication, and protecting API endpoints. DRF provides a flexible toolkit for building APIs, including support for various authentication mechanisms. JWTs are used as the authentication mechanism, where tokens are generated and issued by the server upon successful authentication and included in subsequent requests from the client. A custom authentication backend is implemented to verify the JWT, authenticate the user, and extract user information from the token's payload. API endpoints requiring authentication are protected by applying the JWT authentication class. This integration ensures secure access to API endpoints, authentication based on JWTs, and controlled access to protected resources.

# Why is Djangoâ€™s built-in runserver not suitable for production environments

Django's built-in runserver is not suitable for production environments due to its limited scalability, lack of security measures, and potential instability. To deploy a Django application in a production environment, alternative server options should be considered. Popular choices include Gunicorn, uWSGI, Nginx + uWSGI/Gunicorn, and Apache + mod_wsgi. These servers offer better performance, security, and stability, providing features such as concurrency, load balancing, SSL/TLS encryption, and scalability to handle high traffic. By using these server options, you can ensure a more reliable and secure deployment of your Django application in a production environment.
