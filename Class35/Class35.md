# graph data structure

Graphs are a type of non-linear data structure consisting of vertices (nodes) connected by edges.It distinguishes between undirected graphs, where edges are bidirectional, and directed graphs (digraphs), where edges have a specific direction.

There are different types of graphs based on connectivity, including complete graphs (where all nodes are connected to each other), connected graphs (where all nodes have at least one edge), and disconnected graphs (where some nodes may not have edges).

there are acyclic graphs (without cycles) and cyclic graphs (with cycles), with a specific focus on directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) that resemble trees.

Two common methods for graph representation are explained: adjacency matrix and adjacency list. The adjacency matrix uses a 2D array to represent connections between vertices, while the adjacency list uses linked lists or arrays to list the adjacent vertices of each node.

the concept of weighted graphs, where edges have associated weights. Weighted graphs can be represented using matrices or lists, with additional information such as the weight and name of adjacent vertices.

Graph traversals are explored, specifically breadth-first and depth-first traversals. Breadth-first traversal involves visiting nodes level by level, while depth-first traversal explores the depth of each subtree. Algorithms and visual examples are provided for both traversal methods.
