# Data Structures And Algorithms

 when you need to decide which data structure to use the most important thing is the efficiency of the operations that will be performed on this data structure . the second important thing is to consider the memory usage and space complexity of the data structure, especially if you're working with large amounts of data

# Recursion

To avoid an infinite recursive call stack, it is essential to define a base case that stops the recursion. The base case should be well-defined and reachable by the recursive function. In addition, it is important to use proper termination conditions that stop the recursion in case the base case is not met. For instance, you can use a counter that limits the number of recursive calls.
