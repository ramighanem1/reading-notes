# Groth Mindset
* If you want to get better at programming, you should do something called "deliberate practice". This means doing activities that are a little bit hard for you, doing them often, and getting feedback on how you did. You need to focus really hard on what you're doing. If you do this, you will improve your technical skills and be able to do more things with computers. It might be a little scary to try new things, but it's important to challenge yourself so that you can learn new things.

* The power of believing that you can improve is a fundamental aspect of personal growth and development
