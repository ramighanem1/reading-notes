# reading-notes

This repository contains notes on specific topics that I read during my training. Each topic has its own Readme file where I can add my notes. The main Readme.md file includes a table with links to each topic's Readme file

| Topic | Link |
|-------|------|
| SQL | [URL](./SQL/SQL.md) |
| CommandLine | [URL](./CommandLine/CommandLine.md) |
