# reading-notes

This repository contains notes on specific topics that I read during my training. Each topic has its own Readme file where I can add my notes. The main Readme.md file includes a table with links to each topic's Readme file

| Topic | Link |

| SQL | [SQL](./SQL/SQL.md) |

<!-- | Example Topic 2 | [Link to Example Topic 2 Readme](./example_topic_2/README.md) | -->
